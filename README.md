# Bias-variance dashboard

A small toy Shiny app to demonstrate the bias-variance tradeoff in model training. 
You can see the dashboard [here](https://pommevilla.shinyapps.io/bias-variance-dashboard/).

This app was embedded in [this short introduction](https://pommevilla.github.io/bias-variance-intro/) to bias and variance that I wrote.

This app was purposefully made lightweight for embedding into a Quarto document.
